    headline: "Phone Support",
    detail: "Our phone number is +1 415 341 2432. No-one ever calls because our email support is so good. But in theory, if you called, we'd answer. Try it.",

  {
    headline: "Custom NDA",
    detail: "Naturally we never look at your code. We also have a great security policy, which gives us no rights whatsoever to your code. However, if you would prefer that we sign your custom NDA, we'd be happy to.",

    headline: "Unlimited build time",
    detail: "Great testing means using Circle as much as possible. You don't want to weigh good testing against possible charges or monthly fees. So we have no limit, no per-hour cost, no overages. Just simple, predictable pricing."
  },
  {
    headline: "Lightning fast hardware",
    detail: "We have the fastest test infrastructure around.
Running on Sandybridge Xeons, with tons of RAM, and hardcore IO tuning for your databases, you won't find a faster test service."

  {
    headline: "One-click setup",
    detail: "You can literally set up your tests in 20 seconds. That's less than the time it takes to find the Jenkins download link, and a lot less than the time to requisition a server to host it on. We support every test suite, database, library, and language you need (Linux stacks only for now)"
  },
  {
    headline: "Personalized notifications",
    detail: "You don't care what John did in his feature branch, but you care what gets pushed to master. Who cares if the tests pass yet again, you only want notifications when they fail. Circle intelligently notifies you about the tests you care about, and does it over email, Hipchat, Campfire, FlowDock and webhooks."
  },
  {
    headline: "Debug with ease",
    detail: "When your tests are broken, we help you get them fixed. We automatically warn you about common mistakes, and document how to fix them. We provide all the information you need to reproduce an error locally. And if you still can't reproduce it, you can SSH into our VMs to debug it yourself."}
