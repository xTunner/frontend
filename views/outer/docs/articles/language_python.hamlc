%p
  Circle has great support for Python.
  We can infer a substantial amount of your settings and required
  dependencies from your code.
  When we don't, just create a
  %a{href: "/docs/configuration"} circle.yml
  file and place this
  file in your git repo's root directory.
  Circle then reads your <code>circle.yml</code> file each time we run a build.

%p
  When Circle detects Python, we automatically initiate <code>virtualenv</code>
  to create an isolated Python environment using <code>python 2.7.3</code>.
  Please
  = HAML.contact_us({succeed: ""})
  if other versions of Python would be of use to you.

= HAML['heading']({title: "Package managers and dependencies", hash: "package-mgrs-dependencies"})

%p
  Python is a popular language with many packages and package managers.
  Circle automatically installs your dependencies using either <code>pip</code>
  or <code>distutils</code> when you create a <code>requirements.txt</code> or a <code>setup.py file</code>.
%p
  Alternatively, you can install each package individually,
  although this is seldom necessary.
  In such rare cases, you specify each dependency you need in the <code>circle.yml</code> file.
  Here's an example of how you would do that using <code>pip</code>.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      dependencies:
        post:
          - pip install a-python-package
%p
  Please read our documentation about
  %a{href: "/docs/git-pip-install"}git errors during pip install
  to avoid problems.

= HAML['heading']({title: "Testing", hash: "testing"})

%p
  Circle automatically runs <code>tox</code> when we find a <code>tox.ini</code> file,
  and runs <code>nosetests</code> when we find a <code>unittest.py</code> file.
  Circle runs <code>manage.py</code> test if you are using Django.
  If none of those work for your project,
  you can override Circle's testing by including your own testing script.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      dependencies:
        override:
          - ./my_testing_script.sh

= HAML['heading']({title: "Deployment", hash: "deployment"})

%p
  Circle has first-class support for
  %a{href: "/docs/configuration#deployment"} deployment
  with Fabric or Paver.
  Include information in your <code>circle.yml</code> file to let
  Circle know that your Python project uses one of these tools.
  Here's an example of how to do that.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      deployment:
        production:
          branch: master
          commands:
            - fab deploy
%p
